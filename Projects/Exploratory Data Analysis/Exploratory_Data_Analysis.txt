Hereâ€™s the step by step process that we follow in an exploratory data analysis project:

1- Select a large real-world dataset from Kaggle
2- Perform data preparation & cleaning using Pandas & Numpy
3- Perform exploratory analysis & visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn
4- Ask & answer questions about the data in a Jupyter notebook
5- Summarize your inferences & write a conclusion
6- Document, publish, and present and your Jupyter notebook online
